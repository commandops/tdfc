1 - banana  
1 - large orange or 2 small ones  
handful of baby carrots  
handful of power greens or spinach  
3-4 ice cubes  

That is a great base, makes about 12 ounces 

Add other things to change it up - substitute an apple for the carrots. Add some strawberries.

Fresh boysenberries are so far the best thing I have added and actually noticed, very good.

I buy the power greens from costco and put them in the freezer after a few days. I also but the big bag of baby carrots there. Thinking of freezing them too.
