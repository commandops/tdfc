1 large can baked beans  
2-3 tablespoons molasses  
2-3 tablespoons ketchup  
1 teaspoon mustard 

Drain beans, if the sauce is very thin, and remove lard. Add remaining ingredients and heat. 
The longer they heat, the thicker the beans get. Good to do in crock pot. Do not cover with a lid 
too tightly or else too much moisture will accumulate and beans will be soupy.
