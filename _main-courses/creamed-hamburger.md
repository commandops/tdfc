1 pound hamburger  
chopped onions, to taste  
1/4 cup flour (Wondra Sauce and Gravy flour works best)  
water  
1 cup milk  
salt, pepper, and garlic, to taste 

Brown hamburger with onions. Pour off fat. In a cup, mix flour with water to make about 1 cup. 
Stir quickly while adding water so it doesn't clump. Slowly stir into browned hamburger. It will 
thicken fast. Immediately add milk all at once. Keep stirring. Cook 1-2 minutes. Add salt, 
pepper, and garlic seasonings to taste. 

Serve alone, over toast, or over mashed potatoes. 

Freezes well. 

Hint: Leave burnt drippings in pan to add flavor to the creamed hamburger when making the 
white sauce.
