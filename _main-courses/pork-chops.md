Pork chops, 1 per person  
1 tablespoon butter  
1/4 cup water  
Stuffing, uncooked 

Trim fat off pork chops and slice sides so they don't cud. Melt butter in skillet and brown chops 
on high heat. Put in greased pan. Add water to skillet to loosen drippings. Pour in pan with 
chops. Mound dressing on top of chop. Cover and bake 30-40 minutes at 325-350 degrees. If 
chops are browning too much, or add some water to pan and turn oven down. Uncover for the 
last 15 minutes to crisp dressing, if desired.
