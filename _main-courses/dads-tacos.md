Mom starts by cooking a London Broil in the slow cooker (for a meal with potatoes, 
carrots and onion). With the leftover meat, shred it with a fork to make 2 - 3 cups. 
This can be frozen until ready to make tacos. Or you can brown some ground beef.

In skillet, brown 1 small chopped onion, cook 15-20 min. 
In another skillet, heat small amount of oil, fill corn tortillas with meat mixture 
and fry to crisp the tortillas on both sides. Place on paper-towel lined baking sheet and keep warm in oven until all tacos are fried. 

Serve with shredded iceberg lettuce, diced tomatoes, grated Cheddar or Monterey Jack cheese, diced avocado and salsa. 

Makes about 24 tacos.
