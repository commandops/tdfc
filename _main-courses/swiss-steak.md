1+ pounds of Round Steak  
1 tablespoon butter  
3 onions, peeled (1 per person)  
1 15oz can stewed tomatoes or tomato sauce  
1/2 cup flour  
salt and pepper to taste 

Cut steak into serving size pieces. Trim off fat. Mix flour, salt and pepper in a small paper bag. 
Drop one or two pieces of meat in at a time to coat with flour mixture. Melt butter in skillet. 
Brown meat, a few at a time. Turn heat down. Put all meat in pan. Add onions and tomatoes 
(enough to cover meat). Season with pepper. Cover and simmer for 1-2 hours. Serve over 
mashed potatoes. 

May need to thicken sauce with a bit of flour and water-cook 2 minutes longer to thicken. You 
could omit coating meat with flour and salt and pepper and the meat would still come out good.
