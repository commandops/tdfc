2 cans pie filling, any flavor (cherry is the best)  
1 box yellow cake mix  
1 1/2 sticks margarine, melted  
1 cup chopped nuts  

Spray a 9x13 pan with non stick cooking spray. Pour pie filling into pan, spreading evenly. 
Spread cake mix evenly over filling. Sprinkle on nuts, if desired. Drizzle margarine over cake 
mix to cover as much as possible. Bake, uncovered at 375 for 40 minutes. Serve warn or at 
room temperature, with ice cream, if you want. 

You could also use white or chocolate cake mix, too. The chocolate and cherry combination is 
very rich! 

This makes a fast and easy pot luck dish.
