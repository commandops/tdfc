1 cup butter, softened  
1/2 cup confectioners' sugar  
2 teaspoons vanilla  
1 cup finely chopped pecans  
1 3/4 cups flour  
about 1/2 cup granulated sugar  

Cream butter confectioners' sugar and vanilla until light and fluffy; stir in pecans. Gradually stir 
in flour until well blended. Cover, chill 1 hour or until dough is firm enough to handle. 

Divide dough in 8 equal pieces. On lightly floured board, roll each into% inch wide ropes. Cut into 1 
3/4 inch lengths; taper ends then shape in crescents. Place 1 inch apart on ungreased cookie 
sheets. Bake in preheated 300 degree oven for 18-20 minutes or until light golden and firm to 
touch. Or bake at 325 degrees for 12-15 minutes.

While warm, roll in granulated sugar. Place 
on racks to cool. 

OK to freeze.
