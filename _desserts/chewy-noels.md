2 tablespoons butter or margarine  
1/3 cup sifted flour  
1/8 teaspoon baking soda  
1/8 teaspoon salt  
1 cup brown sugar  
1 cup chopped nuts  
2 eggs, beaten  
1 teaspoon vanilla  
powdered sugar  

In an 8x8 or 9x9 pan melt butter. Sift together flour, soda and salt. Stir in brown sugar and nuts. 
Stir in eggs and vanilla. Carefully pour batter over butter in pan. Do not stir. Bake at 350 
degrees for 20-25 minutes. Sprinkle with powdered sugar. Placed waxed paper under wire rack. 
Invert pan immediately onto rack. Cool. Sift cookies again with powered sugar, if desired. Cut 
into 24 bars. With green icing, write NOEL on each bar. 

Ok to double this recipe; use a 9x13 pan. Freezes well.
