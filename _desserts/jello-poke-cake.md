1 box white cake mix  
1 small box Jell-O, any flavor/color 

Prepare cake as directed. Use any size pan. Cool. 

Mix Jell-O with 1 cup boiling water and 1/2 cup cold water. Let cool to room temperature. Poke 
holes in cake with fork. Pour Jell-O over cake slowly. Refrigerate. Frost as desired with your 
choice of frosting or Cool Whip. 

Great cake and easy to make. Easily adapted to any occasion or holiday, just change colors 
(flavors). Try using 1/2 recipes of Jell-O and mixing 2 colors (pour on one, let cool in refrigerator 
and then poke new holes and add second color). Lots of possibilities.
